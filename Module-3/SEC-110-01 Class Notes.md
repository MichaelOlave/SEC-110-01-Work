- **Cryprography**
      - Practice of scrambling information so that the meaning can not be understud by unautherized users
- **Steganography**
      - Hinding the message
      - Data can be hidden in video and audio files in the meta data 
- **Meta Data**
      - information about the file
- **Plain Text**
      - unencrypted data that is encrypted and decrypted
- **Cipher Text**
      - Scrambled or unreadable text
- **Clear Text**
      - Text not intended to be encrypted
- **Key**
      - Mathmatical value sent through an algorithem to produce cipher text
      - Used to encrypt/decrypt
- **Nonrepudiation**
      - Proves that a user preformed an action
- **Obfuscation**
      - Obscure Data
- **Stream Cipher**
      - One Character at a time
- **Block Cipher**
      - Large sections at a time
- **Hash Algorithm**
      - Has a unique Digital Finger Print
- **Symmetric Cryptography Algorithms**
      - Use one key for encryption / decryption
- **Asymmetric Cryptography Algorithms**
      - Use two keys public / private
- **Public Key**
      - Sharable / visible to all
- **Private Key**
      - Not sharable / visable to all
- **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)**
      - Web sites / programs have a certificate the proves to users that they are authentic
- **File and File System Encryption**
      - *Full Disk Encryption (FDE)*
            - Encrypts the entire disk
      - *Volume Enctyption*
            - Encrypt parts of a disk
- **Self Encrypting Drives**
      - Encrypts every file added
      - If authentication fails you can set it up to delete the entire drive for safty
- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**
      - Chip on motherboard to authenticate device
- **Collision Attack**
      - Attempt to find two input strings of a hash function that produce the same hash results
      - When two files have the same digest
