1. **Understanding Encryption**

- **Question**: What is encryption?
- **Discussion**: Explain the principle of encryption and its importance in securing data.
	- Importance
		- Data Privacy - Encryption protects personal data to maintain privacy
		- Security - even if a data breach was to happen encryption would prevent unauthorized users from accessing the data
		- Regulatory Compliance - there are laws that require service providers to encrypt user information
		- Data Integrity - prevention of data alteration in transit
		- Authentication - encryption is an important technology in various authentication methods  
	- Principles
		- Algorithm - a set of mathematical rules that convert plaintext to cyphertext
		- Key - solution to the mathematical rules to decrypt the cyphertext to plaintext
		- Symmetric Encryption - one key is used to encrypt and decrypt
		- Asymmetric Encryption - pair of keys is used where if one is used to encrypt the other is the only key that can decrypt
		- Hashing - integrity check, takes input and outputs a fixed size of bytes

2. **Encryption Methods**

- **Question**: List known encryption methods.
- **Activity**: Identify and describe various encryption methods, including symmetric, asymmetric, and hashing. Provide examples of each.
	- Symmetric - Uses one key for encryption and decryption, is fast and efficient
	- asymmetric - Uses a pair of keys one for encryption and the other for decryption, more secure but slower
	- Hashing - Provides data integrity, one way function with no  decryption

3. **Applications of Encryption**

- **Question**: Where do we use encryption?
- **Discussion**: Discuss different scenarios where encryption is crucial, such as online transactions, email communications, and storing sensitive information.
	- Answer : Encryption allows you to send data over the internet more securely such as credit cards and other sensitive information. it allows you to send emails that only the intended recipient  can read. If a data breach was to happen all your data would be protected.
