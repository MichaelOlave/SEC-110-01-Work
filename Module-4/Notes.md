End points - devices on a network
  vulnerbilitys - software, other
Malware - software to interfear with a systems operations / steal information
Randsomeware - for extorts money by deniying operation of a system until paied
  blocking - bloccks users from normal use
  locking - encrypts some or all the files on a device so they can not be opened
Keyloggers - logs your key strokes some can take screenshots
  hardware connection can connect to a network for easy access to your key strokes
spyware - tracks software that is deployed without consent (allows them to see what you are doing)
Trojan - program that masquerades as performing a benign activity while actualy doing something malicious
Remote Access Trojan (RAT) - same as Trojan but givs the attacker remote access to the system
File Virus -  takes advantage 
Worm - replicating network virus
Bloatware - programs that are installed without consent of user (preinstalled junk) some may contain malware
Jailbreaking is iligal - apps can be installed that might be dangerus to others
DDOS - copy a file on a system and requesting a large group of other systems to request that file to criple the targeted system
logic bomb - code that is typically added to a legitimate program that lies dormant and evades detection until a spacific logic event triggers it
Rootkit - accesses the lower layers of the OS
Backdoor - gives access to a computer program or service that circumvents any normal security
IOA - indicator of attack - somthing suspisions is brought to attention - if your account is locked - blocked content - impossible travel - concurent session usage - out of cycle logging
IOC = indicator of compermise
Privlage Escalation - attacks on admin users
web-based attacks - takes advantage of a vulnerability so a user can move from the root dir to other restricted dirs
  Dir Traversual -
Domain - readable address that points to an IP address
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - a website that accepts user input without validating it and uses that input in a resonse can be exploited
  attackers can take advantage in XSS that trick valid sites to feed malicious scripts to another user;s web browser
SQL injection - inserts statements to manipulate a database server
  SQL - Structured Quarry Language
  can run scripts in the username field if there is bad coding
Antivirus (AV) - software to examine a computer for file-based virus infections
  scans new docs for virus
Secure cookies -
Host Intrution Detection Systems (HIDS) - runs on endpoint computers
Host intrusion Prevention Systems (HIPS)
Endpoints Detection and Response (EDR)
automated patch managment tools - downloads patches once and distributes the patch to the network as well as delaying and roleing back patches
Sandbox - like a VM but included in windows
Segmentation - separates business data from personal data on mobile devices
  you can use containerization or separating storage into buisness and personal containers
Mobile Device Management (MDM) - tools that allow an organization to manage devices remotely
Mobile Application Management (MAM) - Application management
Mobile Content Management (MCM) - creation, editing, and modification of digitsl content by multiple people
Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) - provides capabilities for managing and securing mobile devices, applications, and content
Embedded systems - hardware and software contained within a larger system designed for a spacific function
Internet of Things (IoT) - any device that is connected to the internet for the purpose of sending and receving data to preform an action
Static code analysis - test that are run before the source code is even compiled and may be accompanied by manual peer reviews
dynamic code analysis - test run after the code is compiled
Fuzzing - used by dynamic analysis
